        <p>
          We know these rules are sometimes hard to follow and make work, but
          unfortunately, these are non-negotiable. These are directions given by
          the State of Georgia and they are in place to keep everyone safe.
          Please review ALL of the terms below and make sure that ALL guidelines
          will work with your photo appointment with us. We CANNOT make ANY
          exceptions on these rules.

        <p>
          Homes must not have ANY people present at the time of our appointment.
          Please ask the sellers to take a walk, go for a drive or do another
          allowed activity away from the house during our appointment. Please
          make sure they are gone at least 30 minutes before our appointment
          start time to allow the home to air out.
        </p>
        <span>.2</span>
        <p>
          Please have home ready for us before we arrive. We are doing whatever
          we can to limit our contact with your sellerâ€™s home. Please have
          garbage cans hidden,all lights on, blinds open and home staged how you
          would like the home to look in the photos.{" "}
        </p>
        <span>.3</span>
        <p>
          Please have a combo lockbox or a hidden key somewhere on the property
          and give us all instructions on how to access the home.
        </p>
        <span>.4</span>
        <p>
          If agent must be present to open the house up, please arrive early to
          open the house and turn all lights on and open all blinds, do any last
          minute staging, etc. Hide the key or place key in lockbox and leave at
          least 30 minutes prior to us arriving to allow the home to air out.
        </p>
        <span>.5</span>
        <p>
          We are working on a very tight schedule. Please make sure home is
          ready right at the start time of the appointment. We do not have time
          to wait for homes that are not ready to go right at the start time. We
          want to make sure all our valued clients are serviced at their booked
          time, on-time!
        </p>
        <span>.6</span>
        <p>
          If we arrive to the home and the home is not ready or there are people
          at the home, we will have to leave and reschedule. This will also
          incur a $75 reschedule fee. We do not want to charge this fee, but we
          need to pay the photographer for their time. PLEASE help us by making
          sure the home is ready and free of people at the appointment start
          time.
        </p>
        <span>.7</span>
        <p>
          If you have to cancel or change your appt, please let us know at least
          the day before the appointment to avoid the $75 reschedule fee.
        </p>

          During this time, we are paying the photographers that work with us
          and employees every week and at a higher rate than normal to help them
          and their families. We are asking for payment for your photo package
          to be made within 7 days of delivery of all materials to help us be
          able to add this extra care for all our contracted photographers and
          employees. Thank you SO much for your help, cooperation and
          understanding with this.
